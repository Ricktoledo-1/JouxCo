                    Andrew Mack a.k.a Joux was originally born in the city of Orange, California. When he was just six
                    years old, he packed
                    up and moved out to a small town in Switzerland called Montreux with his mom, and sister due to his
                    parents divorcing.
                    He began to find great comfort in his artwork. Suddenly he was drawing, and coloring at school
                    whenever he had the chance. He began to draw inspiriation from cartoons he'd watch with his sister,
                    but this soon evolved to inspiration from nature, the
                    streets, and even the artwork he'd see on passing trains.

                Andrew starting painting graffiti back in 2003 and quickly became consumed by it. It was his life, and
                his passion. He was
                painting almost every day, on anything that he possibly could. Trains, rooftops, freeways, trucks,
                nothing was off limits
                for him. He had truly found his self-worth, and a place where he felt at home within the graffiti
                community. He did all of
                this while also maintaining work as a successful carpenter, and he was on top of the world, but

                What he thought to be one of his "trusted" crew members turned him into the police, and suddenly his
                whole life was turned
                upside down. He was
                facing 3 years in prison and went through a very dark time in his life. This led to him giving up on
                art, and on Switzerland
                altogether. He packed up and moved back to Orange, CA with his aunt, during this time he tried to
                continue his profession as
                a carpenter but it just wasn’t paying the bills, so he turned to everything from sales, to warehouse
                jobs, to construction.
                He had lost his passion and was set to settle for a path that wasn’t his own. Luckily that was all about
                to change...

                It was by total chance that he ended up meeting new friends that were involved in the music festival
                scene, and they soon
                invited him to come with them to an event. When he entered the scene, he was in awe of all of the
                incredible artists showcasing
                beautiful pieces and many different kinds of artwork. He saw that this was a place where artists were
                truly accepted. It was a place
                where they could be themselves, free of judgement, and making a living off of their passion. This was a
                major turning point in his life.
                His passion quickly became restored, and he was once again devoted to his art. He made it his goal to
                pursue his dreams and make a living
                through his own creativity. This is the drive that keeps him going today, and it is why he has some of
                the most unique, and original
                pieces in the art game.

            scene, and they soon
            invited him to come with them to an event. When he entered the scene, he was in awe of all of the
            incredible artists showcasing
            beautiful pieces and many different kinds of artwork. He saw that this was a place where artists were
            truly accepted. It was a place
            where they could be themselves, free of judgement, and making a living off of their passion. This was a
            major turning point in his life.
            His passion quickly became restored, and he was once again devoted to his art. He made it his goal to
            pursue his dreams and make a living
            through his own creativity. This is the drive that keeps him going today, and it is why he has some of
            the most unique, and original
            pieces in the art game.
